# Code Challenge 01: Applying Datas and List | ex00 - Shopping Cart

Write a program that simulates a shopping cart. It should allow adding products and calculating the total value of the purchase.

Your program must:

1. Read an integer `nbr`, representing the number of products.
2. Then read `nbr` lines, each containing:
   - The product name (string)
   - The product price (float)

The program should then print:

- Each product with its respective price, formatted as:  
  `ProductName: R$<price>`
- A final line with the total price, formatted as:  
  `Total: R$<total>`

- All prices must be shown with **two decimal places**.

- You can assume the product names contain no spaces.
- The currency symbol (`R$`) must appear exactly as shown.
- The total must be the sum of all prices and printed with two decimal places.
