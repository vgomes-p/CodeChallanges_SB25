Create a program that calculates the final price of a product after applying a discount cupom.

Your program must take two inputs:
1. A float representing the original price of the product.  
2. A string representing the discount cupom code entered by the customer.

#### Discount codes:

| Code           | Discount   |
|----------------|------------|
| DESCONTO10     | 10% off    |
| DESCONTO20     | 20% off    |
| SEM_DESCONTO   | No discount|

After validating the discount code, calculate and print the final price with **two decimal places**.
